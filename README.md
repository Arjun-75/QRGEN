# QR Code Generator
## Overview:
This project is a simple yet powerful QR Code Generator that takes a user-provided URL and generates a QR code image linking to that URL. The project consists of a backend built with Node.js and a frontend designed to provide a user-friendly interface for inputting URLs and displaying the corresponding QR code.

## Features:

1. Dynamic QR Code Generation:
The backend processes user input, generates a QR code for the given URL, and makes it available as an image.

2. Frontend Integration:
The frontend provides an intuitive interface where users can:

Enter a URL in an input box.
Submit the URL to generate and display the QR code.
View the QR code image dynamically after submission.
Cross-Platform Compatibility:
Users can access the application from any modern web browser. The backend and frontend seamlessly communicate to ensure a smooth user experience.

3. Efficient Backend:

The backend uses the qr-image package to generate QR codes in PNG format.
It leverages the express framework for handling requests and serving static files.
